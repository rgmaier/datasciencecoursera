This sub-repository contains code in order to fulfill the requirements set out for Course 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data to obtain the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.

In order to run the R code properly, you will need to have R installed on your computer, the file in a specific directory and the required data files in the very same directory. Once down, simply run the script.

I have not added the underlying data set, as I am most likely not allowed to share this. If you are interested, please reach out to the organizers of the course.
